I have a degree in Software Engineering but I have never been a professional developer or programmer. I am not saying I create scripts to attack computer systems or deface websites. What I am saying is that I am unskilled in virtually all the technical skills required of a modern developer. But I can copy/paste code like a Pro. I have copy/pasted in many popular languages like Python, Javascript and SQL. Some languages I have copy/pasted are not so popular or gone forever - MDX, Occam, Pascal, DBase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I learned the term &lt;em&gt;Script Kiddie&lt;/em&gt; something resonated. I think I liked the &lt;em&gt;Kiddie&lt;/em&gt; part. I have never wanted to me a manager or a CEO. I love being an ‘individial contributer’ I love learning. I am perpetually curious and in awe of nearly everything. Learning is one of my strengths. I learn by doing, trying, questioning and arguing (often arguing with myself). I learn by asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scipt Kiddies are usually teenagers but I realised that my approach to learning and my curiosity and excitment about things are the traits of a four year old. Maybe that’s why I have never felt comfortable as a manager. Would you let a four year old manage a team, or run a company? Most of of my past managers had the good sense not to let me manage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had an epiphany to other day. This is one advantage of being like a four year old - you have epiphanies all the time! I realised that Tableau was founded by a bunch of four year olds and Tableau has more four year olds than any other company I have ever worked in. How Cool is That!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am proud to be Tableau’s oldest four year old. Maybe that is how I will introduce myself in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Robin - I am Tableau’s oldest four year old.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
